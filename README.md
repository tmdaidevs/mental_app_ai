# Document Graph Visualizer

This repository provides a simple web application that lets you visualize text documents as an interactive graph. Each document becomes a node, and edges connect documents that are similar based on their TFâ€‘IDF vectors.

## Running locally

Open `index.html` in your web browser. Select one or more text files and click **Generate Graph** to see how they relate.

## Deploying on GitHub Pages

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. In the repository settings, enable **GitHub Pages** and choose the `main` branch with the `/` root folder.
3. After a minute, your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository>/`.

The site is completely static and only uses client-side JavaScript, so it works out of the box with GitHub Pages.
